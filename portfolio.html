        <p> WordManip is a word manipulation game where the purpose is to form words from others using operations including adding letters, removing or changing them. For instance, fought -> bought -> brought. 
		In the example f was first changed to b and then r was added between b and o.</p>

		<p> 
			The game uses a trie data structure for handling and recognizing the words. The optimal paths and their lengths from other words to others were solved algorithmically. For instance, the optimal path from fought to brought is of length two.

        <p> Physically Based Renderer is a graphics renderer I programmed from winter/spring 2017 on while learning about OpenGL's basic and advanced topics. In the project I utilized several technologies and libraries. OpenGL context
			is created with SDL2. SDL2 also handles input, including keyboard and mouse. SDL2_Image library loads the textures and GLM library is used for mathematics, including matrices and vectors. Model loading is done
			with Assimp.</p>

		<p> 
			In the application I have implemented following things: </br> </br>
			Physically based renderer that uses albedo, ambient occlusion, metallic, roughness, displacement and normal maps. </br>
			Render context switch. </br> 
			Height map reading for the ground. </br>
			Texture loading using SDL2_Image. </br>
			Model loading using Assimp. </br>
			Bounding volume (sphere) and view frustum culling. </br>
			Raycasting. </br>
			Camera movement and rotation. </br>
			Skybox as cube map. </br>

The name for the game comes from words bitter and tetris since the game is a modified 	tetris where there is a good versus evil (bitterness) theme going on. So called evilminos try to cause trouble to the player the way they do. I implemented basic 	  tetris functionality and two other tetrominos, so called goodmino and evilmino. I added some visual effects to the game, such as animating the tetromino blocks 	color between two colors and shaking the camera as the tetrominos land on the play field. Also added some particle effects. This game is ready to be released in <a href="http://www.appstore.com">App Store</a> and will be my first completely personal released title. I will release it in the store once I can afford to register as a Apple developer which costs 100 USD 		per year. </p>

			This work was my own hobby in the beginning of the studies. It was implemented in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>. It taught me about 2D graphics, game design, game programming and concurrent programming.
			I learned that one should not use too many threads in an application because the context switch between the threads takes too much. Moreover, I faced a problem called ConcurrentModificationException as 
			multiple threads tried to access arrays simultaneously.

<p>
			Betting Analyzer was a app I designed during the spring 2016. The motivation for this app was that I wanted to find out whether it is profitable to bet on sports events (football and ice hockey) 
			with certain betting strategies. I created an application that downloads archived sports events from the web. Sports events included data from the actual match which is the teams and the result of 
			the match and also the odds for each result: home win, tie and away win.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The betting strategies go as follows: We select a team from a league and start to bet on it. There are 3 cases. Whether we always bet the selected team to win, or to have always a tie game, or always lose.
			Once we have selected one of these 3 strategies, we have a pattern that we follow in placing the amount of the bet. Constant Bet strategy means that we always place a bet that is a constant regardless of the
			result of the previous bet. Linear Bet strategy means that we always linearly increase the current bet while we lose the previous bet until we win. Once we win, we start again from the initial bet. 
			Linear Steep Compensate Bet strategy means same as Linear Bet strategy but in this case we select a number of losses that we are willing to continue linear increase in bets. While we lose more games in a row than 
			"number of losses" selected, we continue with a steeper increase in bets from that point on until we win. The final strategy is called Exponential Bet strategy. In this strategy we always double the previous bet
			while we keep losing until we win. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This app analyzes these betting strategies using the archived sports events. We use these strategies to archived sports results as if we had placed bets on them in the past in real. This app renders a graph (for a 
			selected betting strategy) that consists of discrete points of which each represents a single bet. The graph then tells would we have won money or lost after for instance 30 matches. If the final point in the graph 
			is on the positive side of X axis, then we would have won some money. Otherwise we lost money and know that there is no use to use that betting strategy on sports events since we would lose money instead of winning 
			it. 
		</p>

	<p>
		    I created the betting analyzer app using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a>. This project was a useful mathematical exercise in coding <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_sharp">C#</a>. Moreover, I advanced my knowledge about 
			<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a>, especially user interface knowledge.

		Implementing a KD-tree acceleration structure for a simple raytracer was an assignment by Frozenbyte for their recruitment process that ultimately never happened in August 2015. During the 
		assignment I learned to find and fix bugs which had been put into the project to add realism. Moreover, I learned about KD-trees and their importance as an acceleration structure in raytracing. Since I haven't earlier
		impelemented a real KD-tree, this was a useful exercise. The task was also to compare KD-tree's performance with model files like the dragon. The files had different amounts of polygons.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The KD-tree exercise was implemented in <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>  so this exercise was also about maintaining my C++ skills and having a mathematical problem to solve.

		 This game was produced during the years 2012-2013 and was started in the Media Lab course Game Project which belongs to Special Module in Game Design and Production. 
     It was my first game project with a team of six student members. Each student had their own role in the development process. My role was game programming which 
     included programming game mechanics and in-game level editor. In the course of the course we designed and implemented a game. This game was intended to be a multi-platform
     game that would run on Android and iOS as well as on PC. Moreover, we implemented a trailer for the game. The 
     game will also be published in the net for open distribution for free. It was more a portfolio game for us than a commercial one.
		</p>
    
    <p> In the game there is a Phorm called character trying to escape from a laboratory that is built inside a cave. The Phorm was born when a mad scientist moved the soul of the 
      character to a gelatinous blob that has incredible abilities and can change between three states of matter, solid, jelly and gas at will. The game is puzzle based 2D game. </p>
    
		<p>
      During the game project I learned how it is like to be in a larger game project and co-operate with your team-mates. This module gave me a better view of game design and production. It 
      also improved my co-operation and English skills while some students were not able to speak Finnish. This project was also about learning from mistakes so that we won't make them again. 
	  The game was created using <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and game engine called <a href="http://getmoai.com/">MOAI</a>.

			Router was a project work in Computer Networks course in 2010 in Aalto University. In this project a router builds a routing table according to messages received from other routers through network.
			I had to implement two protocols, link status and distance vector protocols. In this project I learned about routing and networking. I also learned how to use sockets. Routers were implemented in 
			<a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>.

			Hipster Engine is a Point&Click Adventure Game Engine that was implemented by me and two of my student friends in Aalto University <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> course in autumn 2010. We
			shared the responsibility areas after planning the engine. My role was to implement graphics and interface managers. So I was responsible for input handling and rendering using a
			C++ library <a href="http://www.clanlib.org/"> ClanLib </a>.
			
		<p>
			I learned to design an engine that is composed of modules. I also improved my graphics skills and learned to use external libraries with C++.

		 This was my Bachelor's Thesis work. The programming part was optional but I thought that it is easier to understand how to implement IK solver when you implement it yourself. The 
     implementation uses Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize the error vector, thus directing the end effector to desired location. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This work made me understand how inverse kinematics works and it can be used to produce animation. It also taught me to use optimization algorithms in code. Kinematic chain has three joints. Work was implemented in <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> using
		<a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Documentation">Eigen</a> library

			This work was one of the demos we produced for our customer MultiTouch Oy in Aalto University course Software Development Project I. Demos will be used in exhibitions, where MultiTouch
			demonstrates their products. Products are multitouch screens that can accept multiple touches simultaneously. I worked on this demo with two other programmers.
		</p>
		<p>
		Purpose was to create a fun game suitable for multitouch screens. In the game the purpose is to protect cows from attacking UFOs by throwing rocks that can destroy UFOs. UFOs capture cows by beaming them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This project taught me about software engineering in a larger project corresponding real company projects. It also taught me about quality assurance methods and their importance in software production. In addition, it improved my <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> skills and 2D graphics skills. We utilized <a href="http://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> library in the demo.

<p>
			This project was a game that me and my friend implemented for a virtual reality environment in Aalto University course Virtual Reality spring 2013. The project was implemented with free 
      <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a> and we utilized <a href="http://ruisystem.net/">RUIS for Unity</a> that provided us easy access to Kinect controlled skeletons 
      and Playstation Move. Moreover, it allowed stereoscopic image with passive classes. Programming language used in the project was <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_sharp">C#</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		 The game itself is a multiplayer game created with a sense of humor where one player acts as a Kinect controlled soldier shooting with a rapid fire bazooka on the back part of a pickup.
     The other player controls the pickup with Playstation controller. Enemies are mainly tanks but there are also choppers that drop parachutists as reinforcements. The goal in the 
     game is to destroy the main enemy base with dynamites that can be found in the scene. The player can be promoted up to Colonel in the course of the game based on the points. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This project was very useful for learning things required in game development. First, this game was my first a little bit bigger 3D game and it gave me a better view for creating such games. 
    Second, it taught me how to utilize high level game development tools such as Unity. Third, although we found most of the models in the Internet we had to implement our own models because
    we could not find suitable ones. So I learned also 3D modeling which was awesome with <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-3ds-max/overview"> Autodesk 3D Studio Max </a>
    that is provided for University students for free. For instance, in the image the watch tower and the wire fence are models that I created with Max.

		In this work I learned about OpenGL, its pipeline and the shader system. We used GLSL to implement different shaders like toonshader and directional light.
	</p>

  <p> Keys for the application are following: F1 - Directional light, F2 - Toon shader, F3 - Procedural Shader (Fractal), F4 - Simple Multitexturing, 
    F5 - Point light, F6 - Simple animation (beating bunny), F7 - Spotlight, F8 - Simple Bump mapping specular shader. Moreover, one can move in the scene with mouse and arrow keys. 
    The texture mapping is a simple projection to xy - plane (x,y) -> (s,t), Textures used in the model are 256x256 size. 
    </p>
